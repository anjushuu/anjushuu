- 👩‍🚀 hi there, you can call me rachel, an adventurer and owner of this space station, welcome to planet 51129 💫 
- 🪐 this planet rotates clock-wise as seen above the Sun's North Pole, and within its gravitational pull, you can find small projects that have been launched from its surface 
- 🌃 on the surface to the east, there is an island of 🍄 cabins filled with items of drawing, writing, psychology, and literature; currently, on the grand display is the hobbit by tolkien 🧝‍♀️
- 👩‍💻 this space station operates on python and java technology, and for this month, my goals are to incorporate within brand new javascript and css aspects!
- 📠 fellow travellers can send letters of parchment to ✉️: rt.racheltang@gmail.com, always available to respond to new messages 🌠 :
- 📓 i like to track some life bits on <a href="https://solid-tile-10b.notion.site/eb601fa5677c4ee0a180b88167afb5cc" target="_blank">my notion!</a> it's still a work in progress 🙇
- currently looking for :sparkles: *Software Engineering Internships for 2022* :sparkles:
